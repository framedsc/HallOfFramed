      <div className='about-modal-columns'>

          <p>
            The Hall of FRAMED is a gallery that curates and celebrates the most popular shots that we've
            have taken and shared over the years. In 2019, the <a href="https://framedsc.github.io/">FRAMED Screenshot Community</a> began
            as a place to collate and discuss all we knew about screenshotting. It soon overflowed
            with so many incredible screenshots that we decided it was time to create a gallery to highlight
            the ones we loved the most. And so, in 2021, the Hall of FRAMED was born. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This page continuously updates on its own, thanks to an automated curation system that
            publishes entries to the Hall based on popular vote.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope this gallery serves as an exhibition of the depth and variety of creativity within this space,
            showcasing what's possible in the field of virtual photography. Maybe you'll find it useful as inspiration,
            or just as a <a href="https://framedsc.com/HOFWallpaper/">nice source of wallpapers</a> for your PC and phone.

              You can simply type in the box to search, or you can specify the term you wish to

              types of data you can search for and will guide you along if you click them. 
              Filters can be removed by clicking them in the window. Examples:
